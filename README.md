# TrafficCounter

My take on the traffic counter coding challenge, this program utilises the simple file reader for a single file (which can be changed in the main method of the source code) or for any file the user desires and outputs it to the standard console.

Provided is: Source code, data files, test code

Assumptions: 
------ 
..* The files have their data in a chronological order
..* If a file has less than 3 rows/lines of data, top 3 cars seen timestamps & least 1.5 hour period will not be computed
..* Clean input/machine-generated, thus no faults in the format (ISO 8601)
..* If two 1.5 periods have the same minimum, both are kept for storing and output, I have chosen this with the idea in mind that for example, in the future if there is any extension to this project (e.g. data analysis of traffic) I have already retained the information for the periods of the least seen cars 


Please don't hestiate to ask me any questions!
